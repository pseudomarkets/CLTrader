# CLTrader
Command Line Trading interface for Pseudo Markets. Built with .NET Core. 

## Requirements 
* Visual Studio 2019
* .NET Core 3.1 (SDK for compiling, runtime just to execute)


## Usage
Using the command line trading interface requires a Pseudo Markets account. I will be launching a sign-up page on the main frontend site for this, but once you have signed up all you need to do is sign in with the username and password you created. A user manual will be availble under the wiki.

## Releases
Precompiled binaries are available under the Releases tab.
